Fine tunning image classification models
Ward Greunke

This repositroy covers the fine tunning of image classification models by starting with a base model and then updating some of the layers.

Steps
1. Choose a pre-made model as a base model
2. Obtain your images that you want to clasify
3.   Format images
4. Freeze the layers that you do not want to change
5. Add the new layers based that will be trained on the data.
6. Compile the model
7. Fit the model
8. Test the model
